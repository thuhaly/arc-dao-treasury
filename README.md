## Overview

This project implements **Dao Treasury** functionality on Arc Network's testnet. Arc uses USDC as native gas token (6 decimals), providing a stable and predictable fee structure for DeFi applications.

## Contracts

- `src/`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- Arc testnet USDC for gas ([Faucet](https://faucet.arc.network))

### Build and Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test -vvv

# Deploy to Arc testnet
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.arc.network --broadcast
```

## Network Config

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Network   | Arc Testnet |
| Chain ID  | 5042002 |
| RPC       | `https://rpc.testnet.arc.network` |
| Gas Token | USDC (6 decimals) |

## Gas Optimization

- Tight variable packing in storage slots
- Events for off-chain indexing instead of storage where possible
- Custom errors instead of revert strings
